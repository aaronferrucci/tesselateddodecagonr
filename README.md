# Tesselating a dodecagon with R

## Definitions
> A tessellation of a flat surface is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation)

> ... a dodecagon or 12-gon is any twelve-sided polygon.

## History
I first learned how to tesselate a dodecagon from Col. Robert S. Beard's
"patterns in space" (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2677592-patterns-in-space). At first I saw it as an exercise to be done while sitting at a desk, with compass-and-straightedge. Later, in 1999, I realized the pattern on a more human scale:

* http://www.antfarm.org/~aaronf/bman99/html/daylist_4_td4.html

Back on the small scale, I documented the method of construction, using
PostScript to draw the figures: http://www.antfarm.org/~aaronf/td/tdhowto.html

## Motivation
My goal is to tesselate a dodecagon using R and ggplotwith the final result
rendered as an animated GIF. The ulterior motive is to see how well
these tools work for geometric depiction.
